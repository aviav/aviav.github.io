   - Source: chapter_13_part01.md
   - Reference: chapter_13_part01.md lines 36
   - Evidence: Roman Empire after centralization: 'Between the death of Marcus Aurelius in AD 180 until the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476, there was hardly a decade that did not see a civil war or palace coup against an emperor. Few emperors died of natural causes or in battle. Most were murdered ...
   - Interpretation: Centralized control became extremely fragile at scale - constant internal conflict for nearly 300 years

2. **Venice decline 1330-1800** [supports_premise, strong]
   - Source: chapter_13_part01.md
   - Reference: chapter_13_part01.md lines 12
   - Evidence: Venice post-Serrata: Population peaked at 110,000 (1330) under hybrid institutions, then 'by 1500 the population had shrunk to one hundred thousand. Between 1650 and 1800, when the population of Europe rapidly expanded, that of Venice contracted.' Economic decline under centralized nobility control.
   - Interpretation: Centralized extractive institutions led to fragility and decline while rest of Europe grew

3. **FDR court-packing resistance** [supports_premise, moderate]
   - Source: chapter_19_part02.md
   - Reference: chapter_19_part02.md lines 37-39
   - Evidence: Despite Roosevelt's 61% popular vote victory and Democratic majorities in Congress/Senate, his court-packing attempt failed. Opinion polls showed only 40% support. Senate Judiciary Committee called bill 'needless, futile and utterly dangerous abandonment of constitutional principle.' Fear of 'slippe...

   - Evidence: 'Censorship persisted, but it was patchy and even the most heterodox authors could find someone to print their works.' Catholic Church 'turned the technologies and networking strategy of the Reformation against it, in addition to the more traditional array of cruel tortures and punishments' but 'it ...
   - Interpretation: Centralized control became fragile when facing distributed technology - maximum-leverage tools (torture, censorship) insufficient to suppress distributed printing network

2. **European alliance system 1890-1914** [supports_premise, moderate]
   - Source: chapter_52.md
   - Reference: chapter_52.md line 6
   - Evidence: After Bismarck had gone, Kissinger argued, the great-power system 'aggravated' rather than 'buffered' disputes. Over time, 'political leaders lost control over their own tactics' and 'in the end, the military planning ran away with diplomacy'. From 1890 onwards, in other words, there was a significa...
   - Interpretation: Centralized alliance system became more rigid and fragile as it scaled. Leaders lost control to military planning bureaucracies. System destabilized rather than stabilized over time, suggesting centra...

3. **Network disruption of rigid hierarchies** [supports_premise, moderate]
   - Source: chapter_18.md
   - Reference: chapter_18.md lines 18, 20
   - Evidence: When a network disrupts an ossified hierarchy, it can overthrow it with breath-taking speed... we should probably expect continued network-driven disruption of hierarchies that cannot reform themselves.
   - Interpretation: Centralized control becomes increasingly fragile when it ossifies and cannot adapt - inability to reform makes hierarchies vulnerable to rapid network-driven overthrow

   - Reference: chapter_26.md lines 144-161, 1-151
   - Evidence: US-backed centralized Lon Nol regime (1970-1975) required extraordinary support: 3,630 B-52 bombing raids in first 14 months, then doubled bombing intensity (more tonnage in 3 months than entire previous year), massive economic aid. Despite this, regime collapsed within 5 years. In contrast, Sihanou...
   - Interpretation: Centralized control without legitimacy proved fragile despite massive resource support; legitimacy-based approach proved more resilient

   - Source: chapter_23_part02.md
   - Reference: chapter_23_part02.md line 42
   - Evidence: Centralized chicken operations 'not only were inefficient but posed serious disease and environmental problems' - led to abandonment in favor of distributed contract system. Complete centralization proved fragile and unworkable.
   - Interpretation: Centralized control became more fragile as it scaled - disease risk, environmental problems forced decentralization

   - Source: chapter_16_part01_part01.md
   - Reference: chapter_16_part01_part01.md lines 29
   - Evidence: Chinese centralized states faced constant threat from below at unprecedented scale: 'There were decades in Chinese history when the rate of recorded peasant uprisings was roughly 1.8 per hour.' State survival depended on carefully limiting extraction to avoid rebellion.
   - Interpretation: Centralized control at scale created extreme fragility; extraction beyond certain threshold triggered collapse

   - Evidence: During maturity phase, concentrated financial capital becomes fragile: 'The profits that continue to flow...find a decreasing spectrum of outlets for fruitful investment and become idle money. Thus financial capital is under pressure from eager money growing faster than good opportunities' (lines 49...
   - Interpretation: Concentration of financial capital creates fragility - limited outlets for investment lead to speculation and eventual crises

   - Evidence: During maturity phase, 'as technologies gradually lose dynamism and markets begin to stagnate, the surge of growth moves to the near periphery and later even to the farther peripheries.' Core concentration during synergy gives way to peripheral diffusion during maturity. Later: 'divergence is, by th...

   - Evidence: Qaddafi case demonstrates centralization vulnerability: When leader unnecessarily allowed education and press freedom (more than resource wealth required), educated population coordinated rebellion. 'The people rose up against him' leading to loss of power. Fragility emerged from distributed capabil...
   - Interpretation: Centralized control becomes fragile when population gains comprehension capability, even with massive resource advantage. Suggests capability distribution creates vulnerability for max-leverage.

2. **General principle - middle-class revolt vulnerability** [supports_premise, strong]
   - Source: chapter_12_part01.md
   - Reference: chapter_12_part01.md lines 9-10
   - Evidence: Who makes revolution? It is the great in-between: those who are neither immiserated nor coddled. The former are too weak and cowed to revolt. The latter are content and have no reason to revolt. Therefore, a prudent leader balances resources between keeping the coalition content and the people just ...
   - Interpretation: Centralized control requires maintaining precise balance at extremes (very poor or very rich populations). Middle ground creates fragility and revolt risk, showing operational vulnerability of maximum...

   - Source: chapter_40_part01.md
   - Reference: chapter_40_part01.md lines 422-451
   - Evidence: Pure charismatic rule 'in its purely ideal typical form exists only in its early stages, as it first emerges. Over time, then, charismatic rule becomes more traditional or more rational (more legal).' Must routinize because followers and administrative staff have 'material interest in continuing it ...
   - Interpretation: Highly centralized charismatic rule is inherently unstable and fragments or transforms; cannot maintain pure centralization over time

2. **Russian and German Imperial monocratic administration** [supports_premise, moderate]
   - Source: chapter_42_part01.md
   - Reference: chapter_42_part01.md lines 136-140
   - Evidence: The collegiality of ministries has technical foundations: where it is absent, such as in Russia, and although less markedly, in the German Empire of the former regime, it was never possible to develop an effective degree of solidarity between government agencies. Instead, there was perpetual conflic...
   - Interpretation: Pure monocracy without collegial coordination creates internal fragility through inter-agency conflict. Suggests centralized control becomes more fragile at scale without coordination mechanisms.

3. **Pure enfeoffed feudalism fragility** [supports_premise, strong]
   - Source: chapter_40_part02.md
   - Reference: chapter_40_part02.md lines 354-359
   - Evidence: In pure enfeoffed feudalism, 'the power enjoyed by those who rule is of course quite precarious, since it relies on a will to obedience, and so on a purely personal loyalty on the part of the enfeoffed administrative staff who are in possession of the means of administration. There is therefore a ch...

   - Source: chapter_20_part02.md
   - Reference: chapter_20_part02.md lines 44, 59, 62
   - Evidence: Coup attempt failed because centralized TV control was insufficient: 'since television no longer had a monopoly on the transmission of information, the strategy backfired. As soon as they showed up at a TV station, calls went out on social media for people to go to that location and take it back.' C...

   - Evidence: Extreme wealth concentration in Belle Époque (top 10% owning 90% in France, Britain) 'has never fully recovered from the shocks of 1914–1945' despite return to similar capital/income ratios. 'Prior to the shocks of 1914–1945, there was no visible trend toward reduced inequality'—concentration was st...

2. **General analysis of centralized CPR regulation** [supports_premise, moderate]
   - Source: section_15_part01.md
   - Reference: section_15_part01.md lines 30
   - Evidence: 'the tendency to try to impose uniform rules throughout a jurisdiction, rather than specialized rules that apply to localities within a jurisdiction, makes it extremely difficult for such officials to set up and enforce rules that will seem effective and fair to local appropriators.'
   - Interpretation: Centralized control becomes less effective as it scales because uniform rules can't match local conditions

   - Evidence: Weber's methodological approach uses 'generic, neutral concepts, which only gain explanatory value in definite and specifiable contexts' rather than fixed structural categories. Concepts are deliberately neutral and gain 'function or purpose as specific types of social order' only in particular cont...
   - Interpretation: Suggests social patterns may not be stable, coherent categories independent of context, but rather context-dependent constructs. Questions whether any dichotomy (including max-leverage vs capability-e...

   - Evidence: The hierarchical world of 1517 featured monarchs with 'untrammelled personal power – including the power of life and death over subjects.' Selim the Grim executed so many grand viziers that 'May you be a vizier of Selim's' became a Turkish curse. Henry VIII treated ministers and wives with 'no less ...

   - Evidence: From the early 1500s, this world of hierarchy came under a dual assault from revolutionary networks.' European exploration networks and Protestant networks explicitly described as attacking hierarchical order. 'The authority of Rome having been successfully challenged' led to fragmentation.

2. **Second International failure 1914** [supports_premise, strong]
   - Source: chapter_52.md
   - Reference: chapter_52.md line 10
   - Evidence: The triumph of hierarchy over networks was symbolized by the complete failure of the Second International of socialist parties to prevent the First World War. When the leaders of European socialism met in Brussels at the end of July 1914, they could do little more than admit their own impotence.

   - Source: chapter_13_ORIGINAL.md
   - Reference: chapter_13_ORIGINAL.md lines 99-107
   - Evidence: Democratic Athens combined opposing patterns: aristocrats 'disdained the market' and glorified honor/gift-giving while simultaneously participating in commercial economy and democratic institutions. Same citizens who idealized non-commercial values also 'desired' money because 'it was desirable beca...
   - Interpretation: Suggests patterns aren't mutually exclusive—Greek aristocrats simultaneously embraced honor (anti-market) and participated in commercial society

   - Source: chapter_13_part01_part01.md
   - Reference: chapter_13_part01_part01.md lines 13-15
   - Evidence: Slavery's double consciousness: 'All societies based on slavery tend to be marked by this agonizing double consciousness: the awareness that the highest things one has to strive for are also, ultimately, wrong; but at the same time, the feeling that this is simply the nature of reality.' Equiano's d...
   - Interpretation: Slavery combines pure violence (maximum-leverage) with elaborate moral/legal frameworks that even victims must adopt to function—both patterns operating simultaneously

   - Source: chapter_11_part02.md
   - Reference: chapter_11_part02.md lines 13, 29
   - Evidence: Feudalism justified in reciprocal terms ('peasants provide food, lords provide protection') but operates by opposite logic of precedent. 'Some pray, some fight, still others work' - presented as reciprocal exchange but actually hierarchical. Chapter argues real systems always mix multiple moral prin...

   - Source: section_06_part02.md
   - Reference: section_06_part02.md lines 24-25
   - Evidence: Japanese villages combined self-governance with enforcement: 'Most of the villages hired detectives who daily patrolled the commons... The written codes for each village specified a series of escalating penalties.' But simultaneously: decisions made by village assemblies, rules are self-imposed, app...
   - Interpretation: Systems combine distributed decision-making (capability-enhancement) with monitoring and sanctions (coercion elements). However, coercion is self-imposed rather than externally centralized.

Both cent...
   - Interpretation: Hybrid system combining ruler authority (max-leverage) with distributed privileges requiring compromise (capability-enhancement elements)

   - Evidence: Weber notes that 'while there had been a general evolution in societies from the dominance of social rank to that of class, these designations were not in themselves historical. In particular, claims to privilege persist in modern societies, and so it is important to separate these out from the more...
   - Interpretation: Shows that traditional privilege structures (rank) persist within modern market-based class societies, indicating patterns can coexist rather than being mutually exclusive alternatives

   - Evidence: State simplifications 'are as vital to the maintenance of our welfare and freedom as they are to the designs of a would-be modern despot. They undergird the concept of citizenship and the provision of social welfare just as they might undergird a policy of rounding up undesirable minorities.'

   - Evidence: Oakeshott quoted critiquing pure rationalism, arguing that 'practical knowledge' must combine with 'technical knowledge' for successful action. The chapter's argument structure suggests episteme needs mētis, formal knowledge needs practical knowledge—successful systems require both.
   - Interpretation: If episteme maps to max-leverage and mētis maps to capability-enhancement, this suggests hybrid strategies combining both patterns may be necessary. However, this mapping is interpretive and uncertain...

   - Reference: chapter_114.md lines 84-89
   - Evidence: Steel replaced iron in 1870s-1880s because it was 'technically superior' and 'cheaper' - transport companies 'swiftly shifted to steel' for railways and merchant fleet. Outcome explained entirely by technical and economic efficiency, with no mention of control patterns or capability distribution.

   - Source: section_11.md
   - Reference: section_11.md lines 18-26
   - Evidence: Yu opened channels for the rivers, and yet the people gathered tiles and stones to throw at him; Zichan opened up the fields and planted mulberry trees, and yet the men of Zheng spoke ill of him. Yu profited the whole world, Zichan preserved the state of Zheng, and yet both men suffered slander.

   - Evidence: When studying the 20th century, 'politics is ubiquitous and that economic and political changes are inextricably intertwined and must be studied together. This forces one to study the state, taxes, and debt in concrete ways and to abandon simplistic and abstract notions of the economic infrastructur...

He argues 'desire itself is essentially mimetic, directed toward an object desired by the model' (line 29) and ...

   - Source: chapter_27.md
   - Reference: chapter_27.md lines 5
   - Evidence: 'It was not the strength of the Spanish invaders that doomed the Inca empire, but the empire's weakness.' Ferguson attributes collapse primarily to epidemiology (smallpox) and political fragmentation (succession war), not to Spanish strategic advantages beyond disease vectors.
   - Interpretation: Suggests factors other than max-leverage vs capability-enhancement (specifically: disease, internal cohesion) explain historical outcomes better than the two-pattern framework

   - Evidence: Book proposes 'inclusive vs extractive institutions' as THE explanatory framework, explicitly rejecting geography, culture, and policy ignorance as primary explanations. Endorsements emphasize this dichotomy: 'inclusive political institutions in support of inclusive economic institutions is key to s...
   - Interpretation: Book's 'inclusive vs extractive' pattern may differ from 'capability-enhancement vs maximum-leverage' dichotomy; worth testing if these are same or distinct frameworks

   - Evidence: Spam costs economy $9-10 billion/year while copyright piracy costs $330M-$4.2B/year, yet Congress passed 24 copyright laws vs 1 spam law in same period. 'Lawmaking happens when special interests benefit. It doesn't happen when special interests oppose.' Copyright laws passed 'because rock stars lobb...

   - Evidence: Keynes (1920s): 'more often individuals seeking separately to promote their own ends are too ignorant or too weak to attain even these.' Perez cites this as evidence that 'private and social interest' do not coincide due to both ignorance (cognitive limits) and weakness (power/capability).
   - Interpretation: Both cognitive bottlenecks (ignorance) AND political will/power (weakness) contribute to coordination failure - not one or the other exclusively

2. **Technological paradigm understanding limitations** [supports_premise, strong]
   - Source: chapter_186.md
   - Reference: chapter_186.md lines 3-7
   - Evidence: It is difficult to even design the appropriate framework before the paradigm is fully configured. The potential to be fostered begins to be recognized only after considerable diffusion. Similarly, the problems to be overcome can only be identified after having experienced them.

It has been as easy to blame the recession on the terrorist attack of September 2001 as it was in the mid-1970s to blame stagflation on the OPEC oil price hike. Though both even...

   - Evidence: Post-WWI/WWII policies deliberately reduced 'market value of assets and economic power of their owners' through rent control, financial regulation, taxation of dividends/profits, nationalizations. Low capital/income ratio 'reflected in part a deliberate policy choice.' Different postwar policy conte...

   - Source: chapter_17_part01_part01.md

   - Evidence: After conquering Tenochtitlán—'one of the greatest cities of the world'—and securing the imperial treasury, conquistadors experienced shame, indignation, and frantic debt urgency. Corrosion was present at the moment of their greatest competitive victory, not just during struggle or after defeat.

Simon Johnson notes they likely 'knew perfectly well what was eventually going to happen, but simply didn't care, since they knew the steamroller was going to flatten someone else.'

   - Reference: chapter_21_part01_part01.md lines 91-98, 113-125
   - Evidence: The 'end of inheritance' claim proved false. Inheritance flow fell from 20-25% of national income (19th century) to 4-5% (1950s), leading to widespread belief it had vanished. But it rebounded to 15% by 2010 and continues rising: 'The rebound of inheritance is still incomplete, however, and the evol...
